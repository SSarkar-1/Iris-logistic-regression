# Iris Dataset Logistic Regression Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to classify iris flower species using logistic regression. The project walks through the essential steps of a machine learning workflow, including:

- Loading and exploring the Iris dataset
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training a logistic regression model
- Evaluating model accuracy
- Visualizing results with a confusion matrix

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-logistic-regression.git
    cd iris-logistic-regression
    ```

2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook iris_dataset_Logistic_Regression.ipynb
    ```

3. Run the cells to see the workflow in action.
